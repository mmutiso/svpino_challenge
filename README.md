1. Write a function that reverses an array in place. In other words, the function should not use an auxiliary array to do the work. [[solution]](array_reversal.py)

2. Write a function that finds the missing number in an unsorted array containing every one of the other 99 numbers ranging from 1 to 100. [[solution]](find_missing_number.py)

3. Write a function that finds the duplicate number in an unsorted array containing every number from 1 to 100. Only one of the numbers will appear twice. [[solution]](duplicate_number.py)

4. Write a function that removes every duplicate value in an array. There could be more than one value duplicated. You should remove all of them leaving a single copy of the value. [[solution]](remove_all_duplicates.py)
